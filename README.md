# Barebones-HAMUX
> [HAMUX](https://github.com/bhoov/hamux) built using [equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox), minimal implementation. A temporary solution as HAMUX is being rebuilt.

Build any hopfield network using energy fundamentals. See the original [HAMUX documentation](https://bhoov.com/hamux/) for explanation.

## Install: File copy

All logic is in one file: `hamux.py`. Please copy this file into whatever project you are working on, and modify as needed. You will need to manually install dependencies:

```
pip install equinox jax
pip install pytest # for tests
```

Install correct version of `jaxlib` for your hardware (e.g., to run on GPUs).

Run `demo.ipynb` for an example training on MNIST. *Works best with GPU*

## Install: Pip



## Tests

All basic tests for this package are in `test.py`.

```
pytest test.py
```
