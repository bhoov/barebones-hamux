[HAMUX](https://github.com/bhoov/hamux) built using [equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox), minimal implementation.

A temporary solution as HAMUX is being rebuilt.

```
pip install equinox jax
```

If desired, install correct version of `jaxlib` for your hardware (to run on e.g., GPUs).
