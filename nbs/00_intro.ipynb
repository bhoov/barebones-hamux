    "HAMUX defines two fundamental building blocks of energy: the [**🌀neuron layer**](https://bhoov.github.io/hamux/neurons.html) and the [**🤝hypersynapse**](https://bhoov.github.io/hamux/synapses.html) (an abstraction of a pairwise synapse\n",
    "to include many-body interactions) connected via a\n",
    "[**hypergraph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph). \n",
    "It is a fully dynamical system, where the “hidden state” $x_i^\\ell$ of each layer\n",
    "$\\ell$ (blue squares in the figure below) is an independent variable that\n",
    "evolves over time. The update rule of each layer is entirely local: neurons evolve deterministically by accumulating \"signals\" from only the **connected synapses** (i.e., the red circles in the figure below). This is shown in the\n",
    "following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau \\frac{d x_{i}^{\\ell}}{dt} = -\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial g_i^\\ell}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g_i^\\ell$ are the *activations* (i.e., non-linearities) on each\n",
    "neuron layer $\\ell$, described in the section on [Neuron\n",
    "Layers](#🌀Neuron-Layers). Concretely, we implement the above\n",

    "2.  Perform inference (a.k.a., \"Memory Retrieval\", \"Error correction\", or \"the forward pass\") by **autograd**-computed gradient descent of the energy function!\n",
    "3. Build complex, powerful networks using arbitrary energy functions. E.g., we can easily build the [Energy Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07253) in this framework using a couple lines of code. See [this tutorial](https://bhoov.github.io/hamux/tutorials/energy_transformer.html) (WIP).\n",
