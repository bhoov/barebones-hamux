# Introduction


> `bbhamux` is a *minimal library* to construct Hierarchical Associative
> Memories (i.e., Super-powered Hopfield Networks). Research code
> designed to be easy to use.

## Getting started

> [!NOTE]
>
> This documentation walks through how to use the package as if
> installing from `pip`, but all logic for this repo lives in a **single
> `.py` file**. See [the original
> README](https://github.com/bhoov/barebones-hamux) for instructions on
> how to just copy and use the important file.

``` bash
pip install bbhamux
```
